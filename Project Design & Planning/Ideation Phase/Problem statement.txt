Problem Statement:

* There are increasing pressures from climate change, soil erosion and biodiversity loss and 
from consumers' changing tastes in food and concerns about how it is produced.

* Large farm owners can benefit from IoT applications to collect data regarding the location, 
well-being, and health of their cattle. 

* This information helps them in identifying animals that are sick so they can be separated 
from the herd, thereby preventing the spread of disease. 

* It also lowers labor costs as ranchers can locate their cattle with the help of IoT based sensors.
